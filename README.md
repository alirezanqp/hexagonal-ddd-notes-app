# Notes Management üìù

### Domain: Notes  

#### Description  

**Definition**:  
A domain is a sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. It represents the subject area to which the user applies the program. In the context of this project, the domain focuses on **Notes Management**, inspired by personal productivity and knowledge organization systems.  

---

#### Notes Management  

The core business entities are **User**, **Note**, and **Notebook**. The following outlines the primary domain rules and relationships:  

- **Users**:  
  - A User can create multiple Notebooks and Notes.  
  - Each User has a unique identity and manages their own content.  

- **Notebooks**:  
  - Notebooks are containers for organizing Notes.  
  - A Notebook can contain multiple Notes.  

- **Notes**:  
  - A Note is the smallest unit of the system, representing a single piece of information.  
  - Notes can have metadata such as **title**, **content**, **tags**, **created date**, and **last modified date**.  
  - Notes can belong to one or more Notebooks.  
  - Users can archive Notes, marking them as inactive but not deleted.  

- **Tagging**:  
  - Notes can be tagged for better organization and retrieval.  
  - Tags are unique per User and can be reused across Notes.  


#### Additional Features  

- **Search**:  
  - Users can search Notes by title, content, tags, or metadata.  


#### Users  

- **Permissions**:  
  - Each User is only can manage notes created by herself.

- **Registration and Authentication**:  
  - User registration requires email.  
  - Authentication is managed through secure tokens (e.g., JWT).

## Caching Strategy
The project implements Redis caching using the Aside strategy for note retrieval

## Testing Approach

### Unit tests for domain logic:
Unit testing domain logic ensures that the core business rules and behaviors of our Notes Management system are correct, reliable, and maintain their intended functionality.
